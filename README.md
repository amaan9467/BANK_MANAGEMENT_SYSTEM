The Bank Management System is a Python-based application designed to handle essential banking operations. Users can register by creating an account with details like username, name, age, city, and a randomly generated account number. Once logged in, users can deposit or withdraw money, transfer funds to other accounts, and view their transaction history. The system ensures secure account handling with individualized transaction records. It leverages object-oriented programming principles to create a modular and scalable application for user-friendly banking management.
